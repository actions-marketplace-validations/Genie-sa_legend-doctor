# Pinned command-item selection proof

This bounded extension proves source-wrapped cmdk item selection in controlled source contexts.
Formbricks `SingleTag.isMergingTags` remains unresolved because loaded source contains unknown
dynamic package loaders, preventing proof of the imported singleton’s identity. It does not extend async
segment recognition or weaken atomic-transition, callback-capture, or mount-identity requirements.

## Before and after

Starting checkout: `378977306448c0fc3d0326dbc986f0f6e082b622`.
Tested PR base: `57c8020e70d718eabe57472f1dc9e618d0901f6a`; its only difference from the starting
checkout is README.md. The final reviewed head SHA is recorded in the PR description, so this
file does not attempt to embed the hash of its own commit. Concurrent main-branch changes are
reviewed separately by the coordinating integration task.

The same emitted `source-forwarded item selection` fixture runs against both builds:

The positive fixture fails on the tested base and passes with this change. Its expectation was
written before editing the detector. The Formbricks opportunity was manually audited before the
detector edit and remains explicitly non-enforced. An intermediate implementation promoted it,
but cross-file adversarial review exposed an incomplete import-identity check. The final proof
rejects unknown loaders consistently across all loaded files, superseding that temporary recall
gain. No repository pin, target, or scoring policy changed.

## Audited boundary and assumptions

Formbricks pins `cmdk` to 1.1.1. Its `MergeTagsCombobox` adapts selection to a tag ID and forwards
through the local `CommandItem` wrapper. The pending flag has one render gate, no event reads,
one literal start before the unconditional await, and a completion reset. Independent tag input
and count presentation stay outside the extracted, always-mounted subscriber. The spinner/combobox
conditional remains inside that subscriber, retaining its existing mount/unmount transitions.

The terminal contract was audited in [cmdk 1.1.1 source](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk/blob/v1.1.1/cmdk/src/index.tsx#L625-L680):
`Item.onSelect` is consumed by click and a keyboard-dispatched selection event; it is removed from
the host prop spread. The root's value-change callback has different timing and is deliberately
unsupported. The executable tests use the actual pinned package, not a callback stub.

The proof requires the exact named `Command` import and `.Item` member, only `onSelect`, an exact
owning-package dependency pin, and agreement with installed package metadata when resolution is
available. Resolved application path aliases, absent/ranged/unknown versions, other exports,
shadowing, mutable/escaped imports, and unproven prop transports are rejected. All loaded source
files are checked for alternate imports and static package reexports/imports that could expose
or replace the same terminal. Unknown dynamic import/require arguments in any loaded source file
also block the proof; this conservatively includes unrelated scripts and tests. `asChild` must be absent or false through source-visible spreads.
The tracked callback must survive attribute ordering, not be overwritten by a later prop/spread.

As with the existing framework adapters, package identity is a trust boundary: the contract assumes
unmodified upstream content matching the declared exact pin when dependencies are not installed.
This does not attest registry contents, package-manager overrides/patches, custom bundler aliases,
or runtime monkey-patching from code outside the loaded source scope. Those require separate
provenance evidence; the analyzer does not claim whole-program JavaScript equivalence.

## Measured scenario

Node 22.23.2, macOS arm64, React 19.2.8, Legend State 3.0.0-beta.48, cmdk 1.1.1, jsdom 26.1.0.
Counts cover the pending-start and completion updates only; mount and deliberate parent prop
refreshes are excluded. Click/keyboard and success/rejection produce the same counts.

| Mode       | React owner renders | Migrated owner renders | React selector callbacks | Migrated leaf selector callbacks |
| ---------- | ------------------: | ---------------------: | -----------------------: | -------------------------------: |
| Normal     |                   2 |                      0 |                        0 |                                4 |
| StrictMode |                   4 |                      0 |                        0 |                                6 |

The migrated test uses a `useValue(() => pending$.get())` selector to expose selector work. These
are executed render/selector counts, not render-duration, selector-duration, throughput, or device
measurements. jsdom layout shims do not establish native behavior or real-browser layout cost.

## Seven-app action/disposition deltas

Each target's complete finding inventory was compared by hook, source location, and name.

| App                     | `use-observable` / `change` | `review-state` / `candidate` | Other actions/dispositions |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------: | ---------------------------: | -------------------------- |
| Legend Music            |                           0 |                            0 | unchanged                  |
| Excalidraw              |                           0 |                            0 | unchanged                  |
| Expensify               |                           0 |                            0 | unchanged                  |
| Formbricks              |                           0 |                            0 | unchanged                  |
| Outline                 |                           0 |                            0 | unchanged                  |
| Open WebUI React Native |                           0 |                            0 | unchanged                  |
| Hoalu                   |                           0 |                            0 | unchanged                  |

The seven unchanged corpus failures are the Outline DocumentCopy abstention-reason mismatch;
four missing subscription-relocation practices (Legend Music PlaybackArea twice, VisualizerWindow,
and Hoalu expense-filter-dropdown); and two unexpected Legend Music relocation practices
(GeneralSettings and VisualizerWindow). Practice and grouped-instruction totals are unchanged.

Outline's `isArchiving`, `isRegistering`, and `copying` remain non-enforced because the styled
wrapper/imported style factories require more proof. Expensify's Promise-chain/picker and menu
callback opportunities also remain unresolved. Hoalu's `isEncoding` already matches its
non-enforced label on the starting checkout, so it contributes no recall gain here.

## Reproduce

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
node --test dist/tests/project/analyze-path/command-item-events.test.js
node --test dist/tests/runtime/command-item-pending.test.js
node dist/src/cli.js src --coverage
node dist/evals/run.js \
  --repo legend-music=/path/to/legend-music \
  --repo excalidraw=/path/to/excalidraw \
  --repo expensify=/path/to/expensify \
  --repo formbricks=/path/to/formbricks \
  --repo outline=/path/to/outline \
  --repo open-webui-react-native=/path/to/open-webui-react-native \
  --repo hoalu=/path/to/hoalu
```

For the before/after minimal repro, build the tested base and this branch separately, copy this
branch's emitted `dist/tests/project/analyze-path/command-item-events.test.js` into the base's same
emitted test path, then run `node --test --test-name-pattern='source-forwarded item selection'
 dist/tests/project/analyze-path/command-item-events.test.js` in each checkout. The base reports the
missing event proof; this branch passes. The complete base suite was run before adding that
reproduction file. Temporary mutation checks ran in a separate emitted-output copy and never
changed the branch's source or corpus run.
