# Legend Doctor

A read-only analyzer for React and Legend State in TypeScript and JavaScript.
It reports suggested render and effect optimizations, unresolved opportunities, and code to keep.
Results are JSON; source files are never modified.

Watch Jay Meistrich’s **How to Build the Fastest Apps: Break the Rules** for a look at the state and rendering
optimizations behind Legend State.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
npx legend-doctor /absolute/path/to/app --actionable
```

Or install it once and call `legend-doctor` directly:

```bash
npm install --save-dev legend-doctor
```

Scan the smallest folder that contains the related components, hooks, and observables together. One file rarely
holds enough proof.

## Use it with a coding agent

Copy the skill into your project, then the agent scans before and after every state or effect edit.

```bash
cp -r node_modules/legend-doctor/skills/legend-doctor /path/to/app/.claude/skills/
```

Apply related findings together, validate the changes, and rescan. See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

## Run in CI

The GitHub Action reports findings introduced by a pull request. It is advisory by default.
Add `.github/workflows/legend-doctor.yml`:

```yaml
name: Legend Doctor
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]
  push:
    branches: [main]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
  statuses: write
concurrency:
  group: legend-doctor-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  legend-doctor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@fbc6f3992d24b796d5a048ff273f7fcc4a7b6c09 # v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: Genie-sa/legend-doctor@v0.4.0
        with:
          directory: src
```

Keep `fetch-depth: 0`. The action diffs the pull request against its base branch and needs the history.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for scope, blocking, filtering, and other options.

## Configure

Put `legend-doctor.config.json` at the repository root, or anywhere above the folder you scan. The nearest one wins.

```json
{
  "ignoreActions": ["use-ref", "toggle-observable"],
  "materiality": "compact"
}
```

| Key             | Values                                     | Effect                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ignoreActions` | Action names from [ACTIONS.md](ACTIONS.md) | Hide those findings. They count under `hidden`.         |
| `materiality`   | `broad` or `compact`                       | Minimum owner size for a size-gated render cut, 12 or 8 |

Flags override the file. `--ignore-action a,b` adds to the list and `--materiality` replaces the tier. An unknown key
or action name fails the scan with exit code 2, so a typo never silently hides findings.

To keep one effect on purpose, put this comment above it instead of hiding the whole action:

```tsx
// legend-doctor keep-react-effect
useEffect(() => syncWithExternalSystem(), []);
```

## What a finding says

Every finding has a disposition:

| Disposition | Meaning                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `change`    | Proven. Apply the instruction as written.                                 |
| `candidate` | One fact is missing. The finding names the source to read.                |
| `keep`      | Correct as is. Leave the React or lifecycle boundary alone.               |
| `style`     | Cleaner form. Apply only when the installed Legend State API supports it. |

See [REPORT.md](REPORT.md) for review blockers, grouped transitions, subscription plans, and runtime measurements.
Validate suggested edits with your formatter, typecheck, and tests, then rescan.

## Commands

```bash
legend-doctor <root> --disposition change      # proven edits only
legend-doctor <root> --disposition candidate   # needs a human or agent to read more
legend-doctor <root> --actionable              # one entry per edit, keep findings hidden
legend-doctor <root> --fail-on change          # CI: exit 3 while a proven edit remains
legend-doctor <root> --coverage                # parser and analysis coverage
legend-doctor <root> --ignore-action use-ref   # hide one action for this run
legend-doctor <root> --answer "<id>=yes"       # record an answer to a review question
```

Scope a rescan to the files you touched. The whole root still loads, so proofs stay complete.

```bash
legend-doctor <root> --actionable --changed             # uncommitted files
legend-doctor <root> --actionable --staged              # staged files
legend-doctor <root> --actionable --since origin/main   # this branch
```

See `legend-doctor --help` for all flags and exit codes, [ACTIONS.md](ACTIONS.md) for actions, and
[EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for worked examples.

## Develop

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run eval
```

Read [evals/README.md](evals/README.md) before changing corpus targets, labels, or scoring. `npm run bench` times
the analysis pipeline on a checkout you point it at.
